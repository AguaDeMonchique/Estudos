# Personal Computers
### Anything is considered a computer if has this 4 basic functions:
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Input, Processing, Storage and Output.</span>

### Types of devices
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Workstations</span> = Desktop computer
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Servers</span> = Used to host a file and print sharing server
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Laptops</span> = Mobile version of a <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">workstation</span> 
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Tablets</span> = Portable computer that consists of a touchscreen and computing hardware
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Smartphones</span> = Smaller version of <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">tablets</span> 
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Smart devices</span> = Device that has the ability to compute
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Internet of Things(IoT) Devices</span> = Devices that connect to a network

## Common components computers will rely on

### Hardware
Parts of a computer that  can be <span style="background-color: grey;">picked up, moved around, opened and closed </span>

#### Input devices
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>Keyboards</strong>,<strong> Mouses</strong>, <strong>RAM</strong>, <strong> Microphone</strong>, <strong> Webcam</strong>, <strong> CPU</strong>, <strong> GPU</strong></span>

#### Processing
Hardware is going to be used for Processing, the <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">CPU</span> (central processing unit) or <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">GPU</span> (graphic processor unit). These are the brain of the computer and are used to control everything the computer is doing. They convert some kind of input into something useful and usable.

#### Storage
The act of saving data for future use or retrieval 

##### 2 types of storage
**Temporary**
<span style="font-style:italic; font-style:italic; color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Cache</span> is a very small and very fast type of storage called, which is actually part of our <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">CPU</span>.
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Ram</span> <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"></span>another temporary storage area that computers have.

**Permanent or long-term storage**
we can use things like <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">hard disk drives, solid state drives, USB drives, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs,</span>

#### Output
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>Monitors</strong>,<strong> Displays</strong>, <strong>Printers</strong> <strong> Speaker</strong></span>
### Software
Provides the instructions for the hardware

##### 3 types of software

**OS software**
Provides a method for saving, retrieving, changing, printing, and transmitting information within the computer.
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>OS X</strong>,<strong> Linux</strong>, <strong>Android</strong> <strong> iOS</strong>, <strong> Windows</strong>, <strong> Chrome OS</strong></span>

**Application Software**
Used to create, store, modify, and view information or data
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>Microsoft Word</strong>,<strong> Adobe Premiere</strong>, <strong>Firefox</strong> </span>

**Drivers**
Used to translate commands from operating system to a piece of hardware
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>if I go and install a new video card in my workstation, Windows is probably going to be able to detect it and use a generic driver to at least understand how to display the images on the screen for me using that graphics card.</strong></span>


### Firmware
Is a specialized type of software that's contained on the chip that's going to be attached to the <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">motherboard</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">optical drive</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">video card</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">mass storage host adapter</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">network card</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">modem</span>, or <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">printer</span>.

Nowadays most firmware is upgradeable and this is done through a process called flashing. Because of this, we call most modern firmware flashable.
