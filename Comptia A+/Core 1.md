# Personal Computers
### Anything is considered a computer if has this 4 basic functions:
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Input, Processing, Storage and Output.</span>

### Types of devices
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Workstations</span> = Desktop computer
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Servers</span> = Used to host a file and print sharing server
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Laptops</span> = Mobile version of a <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">workstation</span> 
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Tablets</span> = Portable computer that consists of a touchscreen and computing hardware
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Smartphones</span> = Smaller version of <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">tablets</span> 
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Smart devices</span> = Device that has the ability to compute
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Internet of Things(IoT) Devices</span> = Devices that connect to a network

## Common components computers will rely on

### Hardware
Parts of a computer that  can be <span style="background-color: grey;">picked up, moved around, opened and closed </span>

#### Input devices
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>Keyboards</strong>,<strong> Mouses</strong>, <strong>RAM</strong>, <strong> Microphone</strong>, <strong> Webcam</strong>, <strong> CPU</strong>, <strong> GPU</strong></span>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Processing
Hardware is going to be used for Processing, the <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">CPU</span> (central processing unit) or <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">GPU</span> (graphic processor unit). These are the brain of the computer and are used to control everything the computer is doing. They convert some kind of input into something useful and usable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Storage
The act of saving data for future use or retrieval 

##### 2 types of storage
**Temporary**
<span style="font-style:italic; font-style:italic; color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Cache</span> is a very small and very fast type of storage called, which is actually part of our <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">CPU</span>.
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Ram</span> <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"></span>another temporary storage area that computers have.

**Permanent or long-term storage**
we can use things like <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">hard disk drives, solid state drives, USB drives, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs,</span>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Output
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>Monitors</strong>,<strong> Displays</strong>, <strong>Printers</strong> <strong> Speaker</strong></span>
### Software
Provides the instructions for the hardware

##### 3 types of software

**OS software**
Provides a method for saving, retrieving, changing, printing, and transmitting information within the computer.
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>OS X</strong>,<strong> Linux</strong>, <strong>Android</strong> <strong> iOS</strong>, <strong> Windows</strong>, <strong> Chrome OS</strong></span>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Application Software**
Used to create, store, modify, and view information or data
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>Microsoft Word</strong>,<strong> Adobe Premiere</strong>, <strong>Firefox</strong> </span>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Drivers**
Used to translate commands from operating system to a piece of hardware
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>if I go and install a new video card in my workstation, Windows is probably going to be able to detect it and use a generic driver to at least understand how to display the images on the screen for me using that graphics card.</strong></span>


### Firmware
Is a specialized type of software that's contained on the chip that's going to be attached to the <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">motherboard</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">optical drive</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">video card</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">mass storage host adapter</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">network card</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">modem</span>, or <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">printer</span>.

Nowadays most firmware is upgradeable and this is done through a process called flashing. Because of this, we call most modern firmware flashable.

# Safety Procedures
There are four main areas of safety

### Personal Safety

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Trip hazard avoidance</span>: A trip hazard occurs anytime you have an object in the pathway where people are going to walk.

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">How to prevent:</span>  Always run cables through your drop ceilings, underneath your raised floors, or you should use a cable runway that covers the distance across the floor to prevent people from tripping.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Proper</span> lifting techniques</span>: Whenever you attempt to lift a heavy or bulky object, you can injure your back or strain your muscles if you aren't careful.

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">how to prevent:</span> always lift with your legs and not your back.

if the object is 18 to 20 Kilos its considered a two person or team lift

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Safety gear usage</span>:
is safety goggles, gloves, and masks. When working around certain components, you may be using chemical compounds, such as thermal paste when installing a processor, or compressed air to clean out a piece of equipment.
### Component Safety
Actions taken to prevent damage to components 

The biggest thread to your components is known as <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Electrostatic Discharge</span> <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">(<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">ESD</span>)</span>.

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Electrostatic Discharge</span> <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">(<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">ESD</span>)</span>: Occurs when electrons rush from the body to a component.

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">How can happen: </span>If you just walked across a carpeted floor, you're going to be building up static electricity in your body. And then if you touch a motherboard, an expansion card, or other circuit board, you can actually discharge that static electricity from your body into that component and it will damage it.

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">How to prevent:</span> 

-To prevent <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">ESD</span> from damaging your components, you should always carry your components around in an antistatic bag that protects it from ESD by using a coating inside of that bag that is a conductive material.

-When it comes time to handle the components for installation, you're going to need to wear an <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">ESD</span> wrist strap that discharges the static electricity from your body into a ground. And this 
prevents an electrostatic discharge from going into the components instead.

-<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">ESD</span> mat that holds the computer and the components when I go to install the components into a given system.
### Electrical Safety
To protect yourself from the threat of electrocution, you should always unplug the computer prior to working inside of its case.

Ex.:  <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">you're going to install more memory or replace an expansion card, you should fully shut down the computer, unplug the power cord, and then go to work on the system.</span>

### Chemical Safety
