## Common components computers will rely on

### Hardware
Parts of a computer that  can be <span style="background-color: grey;">picked up, moved around, opened and closed </span>

#### Input devices
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>Keyboards</strong>,<strong> Mouses</strong>, <strong>RAM</strong>, <strong> Microphone</strong>, <strong> Webcam</strong>, <strong> CPU</strong>, <strong> GPU</strong></span>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Processing
Hardware is going to be used for Processing, the <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">CPU</span> (central processing unit) or <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">GPU</span> (graphic processor unit). These are the brain of the computer and are used to control everything the computer is doing. They convert some kind of input into something useful and usable.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Storage
The act of saving data for future use or retrieval 

##### 2 types of storage
**Temporary**
<span style="font-style:italic; font-style:italic; color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Cache</span> is a very small and very fast type of storage called, which is actually part of our <span style="color:rgb(0, 176, 240)">CPU</span>.
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Ram</span> <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"></span>another temporary storage area that computers have.

**Permanent or long-term storage**
we can use things like <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">hard disk drives, solid state drives, USB drives, CDs, DVDs, Blu-ray discs,</span>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#### Output
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>Monitors</strong>,<strong> Displays</strong>, <strong>Printers</strong> <strong> Speaker</strong></span>

------
## Software
Provides the instructions for the hardware

##### 3 types of software

**OS software**
Provides a method for saving, retrieving, changing, printing, and transmitting information within the computer.
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>OS X</strong>,<strong> Linux</strong>, <strong>Android</strong> <strong> iOS</strong>, <strong> Windows</strong>, <strong> Chrome OS</strong></span>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Application Software**
Used to create, store, modify, and view information or data
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>Microsoft Word</strong>,<strong> Adobe Premiere</strong>, <strong>Firefox</strong> </span>

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
**Drivers**
Used to translate commands from operating system to a piece of hardware
Ex.: <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><strong>if I go and install a new video card in my workstation, Windows is probably going to be able to detect it and use a generic driver to at least understand how to display the images on the screen for me using that graphics card.</strong></span>


### Firmware
Is a specialized type of software that's contained on the chip that's going to be attached to the <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">motherboard</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">optical drive</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">video card</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">mass storage host adapter</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">network card</span>, <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">modem</span>, or <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">printer</span>.

Nowadays most firmware is upgradeable and this is done through a process called flashing. Because of this, we call most modern firmware flashable.

# Safety Procedures
There are four main areas of safety

### Personal Safety

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Trip hazard avoidance</span>: A trip hazard occurs anytime you have an object in the pathway where people are going to walk.

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">How to prevent:</span>  Always run cables through your drop ceilings, underneath your raised floors, or you should use a cable runway that covers the distance across the floor to prevent people from tripping.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)"><span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Proper</span> lifting techniques</span>: Whenever you attempt to lift a heavy or bulky object, you can injure your back or strain your muscles if you aren't careful.

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">how to prevent:</span> always lift with your legs and not your back.

if the object is 18 to 20 Kilos its considered a two person or team lift

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Safety gear usage</span>:
is safety goggles, gloves, and masks. When working around certain components, you may be using chemical compounds, such as thermal paste when installing a processor, or compressed air to clean out a piece of equipment.

---
### Component Safety
Actions taken to prevent damage to components 

The biggest thread to your components is known as <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Electrostatic Discharge</span> <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">(<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">ESD</span>)</span>.

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Electrostatic Discharge</span> <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">(<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">ESD</span>)</span>: Occurs when electrons rush from the body to a component.

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">How can happen: </span>If you just walked across a carpeted floor, you're going to be building up static electricity in your body. And then if you touch a motherboard, an expansion card, or other circuit board, you can actually discharge that static electricity from your body into that component and it will damage it.

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">How to prevent:</span> 

-To prevent <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">ESD</span> from damaging your components, you should always carry your components around in an antistatic bag that protects it from ESD by using a coating inside of that bag that is a conductive material.

-When it comes time to handle the components for installation, you're going to need to wear an <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">ESD</span> wrist strap that discharges the static electricity from your body into a ground. And this 
prevents an electrostatic discharge from going into the components instead.

-<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">ESD</span> mat that holds the computer and the components when I go to install the components into a given system.

### Electrical Safety
To protect yourself from the threat of electrocution, you should always unplug the computer prior to working inside of its case.

Ex.:  <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">you're going to install more memory or replace an expansion card, you should fully shut down the computer, unplug the power cord, and then go to work on the system.</span>

### Chemical Safety
Chemical safety includes <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">proper handling</span> and <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">disposal</span> of hazardous materials and chemicals

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">This includes lithium batteries, toner from laser printers, hazardous materials and components such as lead, mercury and arsenic, and many others.</span> 

For each chemical or hazardous material that you work with in your job, you should have access to a material safety data sheet known as the MSDS, which contains all the information about the ingredients, health hazards, precautions, and first aid information for that given chemical or hazardous material that you're going to be working with.

------------------------------------------
# Troubleshooting Methodology 

## CompTIA troubleshooting 6 steps

### 1º Step: Identify the problem

When you attempt to identify the problem you should gather information from the user, identify user changes, and, if applicable, perform backups before you make any kind of changes. You should also ask if there's been any environmental or infrastructure changes recently because those could also affect the system too.

### 2º Step: Establish a theory of probable cause.


if the system won't power on, you should probably check that the workstation is actually plugged into the wall outlet properly and that the wall outlet actually has power. As you attempt to establish a theory of probable cause you may also need to conduct external or internal research based on the symptoms that are being displayed. One of my favorite troubleshooting tools is Google

### 3º Step: Test the theory to determine the cause.

In step three, it's time to test that theory. 

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Using the example of the computer that wouldn't turn on. Maybe you suspected the outlet was faulty. Now the easiest way to test this is to plug your computer into another outlet and try to power it on. If the computer powers on, then guess what, you know the outlet was the problem. Once that theory is confirmed, then you need to determine the next steps to resolve that problem. In the case of a power outlet that's not working, that might mean that you need to replace the power outlet or put in a work order for an electrician to come out and then replace that outlet for you depending on your skill level and the company policies.</span>

Now if the theory is not confirmed then we need to reestablish a new theory by guessing what else could be the problem, or, if you're truly stuck, then you could escalate that problem to the next higher tier of support such as a coworker or the field services technicians.

### 4º Step: Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem

Establish a plan of action to resolve the problem and implement the solution

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">Going back to the power outlet example, our plan of action is to replace the outlet. The solution to implement that is to buy and replace the outlet or put in a work order so a professional electrician can replace it for us.
</span>

If you're working on a computer system, remember, it's always a good idea to refer to the manufacturer or vendor's instructions for repairing or replacing its components.

### 5º Step: Verify full system functionality

Now at this point, you figured out the issue, you've implemented the solution, and hopefully you've solved this issue. But to verify that you need to check the system and verify the system is fully functional. Also, if the issue is one that could have been prevented, now is a good time to implement preventative measures. 

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">For example, if an employee spilled their coffee on their laptop and this short circuited their keyboard, you might implement a preventative measure by having the company issue a memo to all of the employees that says you can only drink if you're using a cup that has a covered lid when you're using a company provided laptop or workstation because this prevents inadvertent spills.</span>


###  6º Step: Document the findings, actions, and outcome.

Now that all the work is done, we want to take a moment to document what was wrong, what we did to solve it, and what the final outcome was. <span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">So, let's go back to the spilled coffee on the laptop example.</span> 

You might go to the trouble ticket system and document the findings and actions as,

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"The user's laptop keyboard was not responsive.</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"Upon visual inspection,</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"the keyboard appeared to be sticky and damaged.</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"When I opened up the laptop, I saw residual brown liquid</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"suspected to be coffee.</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"I removed the internal keyboard,</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"dried the laptop overnight,</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"installed a new keyboard, and retested the system</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"to verify everything was functional again."</span>

Now, under the outcome in the ticket, you could then enter,

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"End user laptop has been fully restored to service</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"after replacing the internal keyboard.</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"The end user was advised to be careful with liquids</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"around company equipment</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"and to use a lid</span>
<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">"when drinking near any electronic equipment."</span>

# USB Cables 

## Serial Cables
serial cables were connected to a computer using either a DB9 or DB25 connector. But DB9 was more common

<span style="color:rgb(135, 206, 235)">DB9</span> is a D-shaped sub-miniature pin at the back of the computer. And this particular cable connector would actually have two thumb screws on the side, that you would screw that serial cable into the serial port on the back of a computer's motherboard.

the fastest you're going to find these is up to about 115,000 bits per second, which is often written and spoken as 115 kilobits per second.

Now when you see a serial cable, normally it is going to be a DB9 type of connector as shown here. These are going to be used for a slow speed connection, and generally for much older mice, keyboards, and external modems.


## USB
Using USB we can connect up to 127 devices to our computer through USB Hubs


But each particular port is controlled by what's known as a host controller, and each host controller uses the same amount of bandwidth for all devices on that particular port. So if I have one device connected to a USB port and it's a USB 3 type of port that supports five gigabits per second, I can give all five gigabits per second to that one device. But if I daisy change five different devices on that same port, I now can only give up to one gigabit per second to each of those devices because they're sharing that total of five gigabits per second across all the devices in that particular chain.
